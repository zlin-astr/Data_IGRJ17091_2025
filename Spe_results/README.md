The files named [telescope]_spe_table.csv contain the spectral fitting results obtained using the model "tbabs*powerlaw". The uncertainties are recorded as the 1sigma lower and upper bounds.

The file joint_fit_zxipcf_table.csv provides the spectral fitting results from joint fits of spectra within the same cycle using the model "tbabs*zxipcf*cabs*powerlaw". The powerlaw component was linked across all spectra within the same cycle. During the non-dip phase, the parameters of the zxipcf component were fixed to zero. The uncertainties are recorded as the 1sigma lower and upper errors.

All quoted fluxes refer to unabsorbed values.
